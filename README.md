"This is an ongoing C++ project that utilizes object-oriented design at the top level of design and implementation. The project was part of my software engineering degree, and every function was tested to ensure functionality. I hope to add a GUI soon and add many more features to the application as it is still in the early stages of where I hope to take it."
